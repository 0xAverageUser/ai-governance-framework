Unauthorised actors may gain training data and model access through insufficient data storage security. Other regulations stipulate secure storage of data (leading to regulatory and legal issues), however RAG data, model training data, and the model itself may be at risk.

**Severity**

Severity is linked to the classification and sensitivity of the data being stored. If the data is public, there is no risk. If the data is sensitive, the risk is high.
