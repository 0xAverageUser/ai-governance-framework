Lacking sufficient data storage security leaves your project vulnerable to outside actors gaining access to the data used for your model potentially exposing your data to be taken and used or tampered with to corrupt and misuse your model. Many regulations covering within industry also have requirements for the secure storage of data, especially in cases where it can be used to identify people, meaning improper security can put you at risk of regulatory and legal issues alongside the risk of losing your users trust in the system you have developed.

#### Severity

The severity of this risk depends largely on the data you are storing, if the RAG system is simply creating a more usable and accessible access point to information that is already public there is no real risk associated with the data being accessed by an outside party. However if you have information that you want to restrict and control access to, it is important to both have strong access controls and to properly secure the data at all points in the system.
