Users of Chat App can craft prompts that are sent to chat.com and potentially cause damaging responses.

Those responses may include out of scope responses, incorrect answers, information disclosure, denial of service etc.

A model inversion attack is possible if the attacker can craft prompts that reveal the model's internal workings, which
can be used to steal the model's training or RAG data.
