title: Preserving access controls in the ingested data
---

When ingesting data to be queried using RAG architecture, the source may have defined different access levels boundaries that are lost in the destination vector storage.
The vector storage may support different access controls, which you should verify that they replicate the original source data ones.

Source data can be segregated in different replicated RAG architectures corresponding to different access level boundaries. Users of a specific domain can then only 
be permissioned to access the instance of the RAG that holds the data that they should have access to.

System prompt access control techniques are available, whereaby a system prompt may be designed to build access controls into the RAG. This is ineffecient and has been to 
proved to be easily bypassed. So this should be avoided as a mechanism of developing access controls into the RAG architecture.



- segregating storage into diffent stores
- future integration points that may come in foundation model or vector store
- access control restrictions on the chat app

In trying to preserve access controls in the ingested data the corporate access control should be replicated.
