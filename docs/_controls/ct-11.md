Human Feedback Loop

There are several aspects of human feedback loop which are crucial to implementation of GenAI in any real world usecase. Witout a good feedback, solution won't be as effective as it can be. Also there won't be any scope to improve it over time. Following are some of the considerations one should keep it mind while designing feedback loop:

1. Feedback should be aligned with your KPI. One should define good set of KPI and evaluation metrics for a solution for e.g. how many queries were answered by correct answers annotated by subject matter experts (SME). KPI based feedback can be both quantitative and qualitative.
2. Intended use of feedback data should be defined. Thge developers of the solution should take the feedback based upon the inetended use of the data i.e. prompt finetuning or RAG docuemnt finetuning  or finetuning of the model itself. Defining these goals of the data usage will make sure the solution designed for long term.

There are several ways one collect the feedback.
