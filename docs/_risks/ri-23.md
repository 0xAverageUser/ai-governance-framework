title: Intellectual Property (IP) and Copyright 

---

- Generative AI models often train on datasets that may include copyrighted material.  
- Using AI in financial settings raises intellectual property (IP) risks.  
- Firms could be liable if AI-generated content inadvertently includes copyrighted material.  
- AI outputs may closely resemble copyrighted text, code, or proprietary algorithms, leading to infringement claims.  
- AI-generated content provided to customers must be accurate and legally compliant.  
- Trade secret risks arise if employees input proprietary data into public AI models.  
- Some firms have accidentally leaked sensitive code or strategies through AI tools.  
- Financial institutions must ensure AI models and APIs are properly licensed for commercial use.  
- Improper use of AI can lead to IP lawsuits and loss of confidential business information.
