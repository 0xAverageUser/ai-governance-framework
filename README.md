# AI Readiness

Our goal is to mutually develop a governance framework that manages the on-boarding, development of, and running AI-based solutions within financial services organisations - allowing us all to unlock the potential of this disruptive technology.

## Introduction

The recent advances in AI (and more specifically Generative AI) are poised to have a disruptive impact across both our business and home lives. The rapid advances (that are showing no sign of slowing) are leading to a wealth or potential that touches upon the products we (within financial services) offer to clients, our personal productivity as well as the operational aspects of our business. Very few technologies in the past have had such a broad 'reach'.

There are certainly challenges and issues with the current technology (hallucinations, prompt injections), but things are moving at pace, and the technology challenges we see today may not exist tomorrow.

There is a very strong desire to on-board, trial, experiment and release products using this technology across the FINOS membership and broader FS community. However, as an industry we have some unique challenges.

All banks have mature processes for on-boarding technology, however, (Generative) AI presents some new challenges that the existing processes may not be well-suited to addressing. Without going into the details, there is much work needed to allow the 'safe' use of AI (where safety considers both the customer and the bank) and ultimately allow FS organisations to rapidly adopt new technologies as they emerge.

## Goals and approach

The AI readiness group is at the very early formation stages, as a result, the goals and approach will likely evolve in the near-term. The current proposed approach to creating tangible value to members is:

 - **Focus on a subset of the problem** - with the breadth of AI technologies and applications, we cannot realistically tackle the problem all in one go. We’ll seek to identify a subset of the problem, driven by one or more specific use cases, in order to create a complete ‘vertical slice’ and deliver value early
 - **Leverage existing frameworks** -  financial services organisations already have robust frameworks in place for dealing with technology risk. We’ll look to leverage these framework, or approaches, where appropriate.
 - **Threat modelling** - for our selected use case(s), we’ll use threat modelling techniques to map out the challenge, then identify suitable mitigation 

## Membership

The AI Readiness is FINOS members only while we are in the formation stage. To join the group, please contact membersuccess@finos.org 

We use the following channels:
 - Group email distribution list: ai-readiness-private@lists.finos.org
 - Meetings follow Chatham House rules, with no formal minutes, however, actions and conclusions will be shared via the email distribution list.

Considering that there is a significant amount of work needed to build this framework, we have a smaller ‘core team’ who meet and work on this project outside of the fortnightly meetings. The current core team are:

 - Colin Eberhardt, CTO, Scott Logic (co-chair)
 - Ian Micallef, Citi, ICG Head of Developer Engineering  (co-chair)
 - Madhu Coimbatore, Morgan Stanley, Executive Director, AI Platform Development
 - Andrew Martin, CEO, ControlPlane
 - Oleg Blokhin, Executive General Manager, Provectus

We welcome further core team members.
